            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/profile.png" alt="My profile picture">
        <p>My name is Miracle Lawrence, a passionate educator and software development student with a strong background 
                in mathematics and over five years of teaching experience. I’m deeply committed to helping students build 
                confidence in learning, especially in math and science, and I create engaging educational content, including 
                games and videos, to make learning fun for kids. I’ve completed the PathwayConnect program and am currently 
                pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Development, with a growing interest in tech-based furniture design. 
                I also lead a programming study group and actively support peers in their learning journey. My goal is to combine 
                creativity, technology, and education to make a meaningful impact.

                    <p>My country is Nigeria, located in West Africa, bordered by Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. It is the most populous 
                        country in Africa and has a rich cultural heritage with over 250 ethnic groups, each with its own unique languages, 
                        traditions, and customs. Nigeria is known for its vibrant music, diverse cuisine, colorful festivals, and resilience 
                        of its people. From the bustling city of Lagos to the historic sites of Kano and the natural beauty of the Niger Delta, 
                        Nigeria stands as a land of diversity, strength, and opportunity.
